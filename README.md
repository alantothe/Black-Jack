# Blackjack 

I will creating a Blackjack game for my Final Project.

As of now it will be a standard 1v1 game between the Dealer and 1 player.

I would like to add gambling and multiple players but not sure if I can do that by the 17th. 


# Game Features

* Dealing Cards to Players
* Option To Hit or Stand
* Dealer Stands on 17
* Insurance 
* Ace has a value of 11 or 1 depending on the value of the hand. 
* Push Rule
